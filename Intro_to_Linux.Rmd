## What is Linux, and why should I care about it?

 - Linux is a family of Free Open Source Software (FOSS) operating systems
which is widely used.

 - Linux is particularly well-suited to academics, researchers, and sofware developers
 
 - This presentation will introduce you to Linux, and will show you how you can use it to make your computing more enjoyable and productive

## History - Unix

 - The operating system Unix was developed at Bell Labs in the U.S.A. in the 1970s
 - Very widely used, but proprietary
 - Many tools (like the C language) were developed with and for Unix

## History - GNU
 - The GNU (GNU's not Unix) project was developed in the 1990s to produce a free version of Unix
 - https://www.gnu.org/
 - based on 4 freedoms:
 (0) to run the program, 
 (1) to study and change the program in source code form, 
 (2) to redistribute exact copies, and 
 (3) to distribute modified versions.
 - GNU produced most of the OS, and the tools including language compilers, but never completed the kernel, which controls the hardware

## History - Linux Torvalds
 - in 1991 Linus Torvals, a Finnish teenager, started working on Linux, a FOSS 
unix-like kernel
 - version 1.0 released in 1994
 - Linux + GNU provides basis for many operating systems
 - Linux development is sponsored by the Linux Foundation, a non-profit, which pays Linus to develop Linux
 - Most of Linux is written by others, including programmers from large companies like IBM, Amazon, Red Hat and Microsoft
 - Now the largest cooperative project in the world, and the largest codebase in the world.
 
## History - today
 - Linux is the most widely used operating system kernel in the world
 - Most servers
   - Google
   - Amazon
   - Microsoft Azure cloud
 - All supercomputers
 - Android
 - Chromebooks
 - About 2% of desktop/laptops
 
## Distros
- There are many different Linux distributions ("Distros")
  - some are for primarily for servers (Red Hat, Debian)
  - some are for desktops (Ubuntu, Mint)
  - some are for experts (Arch, Gentoo)
- All versions can run the same applications
- Differences are in 
  - how support is provided 
  - how often the distro is upgraded
  - how software is installed
  - default software
